"0"-prefixed scripts are executed from bin/
"subject"-prefixed scripts are linked to individual subject/session directories
	and executed from there.

Step-by-step
------------
1. Execute '01-linkproc.sh' to link the "subject" scripts within subject
   directories.

2. Within each session directory, execute 01-extract.sh to convert DICOMs and
   PAR/RECs to NIFTI.

3. Again, within the same directory, execute 02-makeafniscript.sh to create
   proc.* scripts for each A-F file.

4. Execute each proc.* script (e.g. `./proc.RC4202.ANT_A`) in order to
   preprocess each task file. It takes about 15 hours on a single core.
